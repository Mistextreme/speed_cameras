# After the new update release, you no need to create new zones, radars, and objects every time—just copy the ones you’ve already created:

# [autogenerated_objects.lua]
# [autogenerated_radars.lua]
# [autogenerated_zones.lua]

# and replace them!

# [PLEASE_ALLWAYS_HAVE_BACKUP_VERSION_OF_THIS_SYSTEM] -> [intersystems_speed_cameras]
